In this project, the logical diagram illustrates the architecture of a secure, monitored environment hosted on VULTR's cloud platform. The setup includes several servers and components that work together to ensure network security and manage potential threats.
Core Components:

    Private Network on VULTR:
        This network has a specific IP range (172.31.0.0/24) and includes all the essential servers, ensuring they communicate within a secure, isolated environment.

    Servers within the Private Network:
        Windows Server with RDP: This server is configured to allow remote access via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It forwards its logs to the Elastic & Kibana server for monitoring.
        Ubuntu Server with SSH: A Linux-based server that allows secure command-line access via SSH. Like the Windows server, it sends its logs to the Elastic & Kibana server.
        Fleet Server: Manages agents deployed on both the Windows and Ubuntu servers, ensuring they are properly monitored and secure.

    Elastic & Kibana Server:
        Central to the monitoring setup, this server collects and analyzes logs from all other servers in the private network. It provides a user-friendly interface (Kibana) for visualizing this data and can trigger alerts if any suspicious activity is detected.

    OS Ticket Server:
        Handles incident tickets generated by the Elastic & Kibana server. This helps in tracking and managing security incidents efficiently.

External Interactions:

    SOC Analyst's Laptop:
        The security analyst (SOC) connects to the Elastic & Kibana server through a web interface to monitor and respond to any alerts or incidents in real-time.

    Attacker's Laptop (Kali Linux) and C2 Server Mythic:
        These represent potential threats. The Kali Linux laptop simulates an attacker, while the C2 server represents a command-and-control server used for managing compromised systems. The setup is designed to detect and respond to activities from these external threats.

Flow and Security:

    Log Management: Logs from the Windows and Ubuntu servers are forwarded to Elastic & Kibana for real-time monitoring.
    Threat Detection: The SOC analyst uses Kibana to detect any abnormal activities, such as those from the attacker's laptop or C2 server.
    Incident Management: Alerts generated by Kibana are turned into tickets by the OS Ticket server, ensuring incidents are tracked and resolved.

This setup ensures that all server activities are closely monitored, potential threats are quickly identified, and incidents are efficiently managed, making it a robust solution for maintaining network security.
