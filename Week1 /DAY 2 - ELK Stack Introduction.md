ELK stack is an acronym for stack that comprises three popular projects : Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 

**Elasticsearch** is a distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene.  As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fine‑tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.  It uses standard RESTful APIs and JSON. 

**Logstash** is a free and open server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources, transforms it, and send it to our favorite "stash."

**Kibana** can be used from discovering documents to analyzing logs to finding security vulnerabilities. Searching for hidden insights, managing our data, and even securing the Elastic search and much more can be done with Kibana. 

Elk stack gives the ability to aggregate logs from all of our system and applications, analyze those logs, and create visualizations for application and infrastructure monitoring , faster troubleshooting, security analytics, and more.  

Comparing ELK stack to Splunk have these similarities :

Elasticsearch = Indexer/ Search Head 
Logstash = Heavy Forwarder
Kibana = Web GUI
Beats/Agents = Universal Forwarders
